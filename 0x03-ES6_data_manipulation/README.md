# JavaScript Data Structures and Methods

Welcome to the JavaScript Data Structures and Methods project! This repository provides examples and explanations of key JavaScript concepts. By the end of this project, you should be able to confidently explain the following:

## Learning Objectives

- **Array Methods:**
    - **`map()`:** Transform each element in an array using a provided function.
    - **`filter()`:** Create a new array with elements that pass a specific condition.
    - **`reduce()`:** Reduce an array to a single value by applying a function to an accumulator and each element.

- **Typed Arrays:**
    - Understand typed arrays and their use cases.
    - Explore different types, such as `Int8Array`, `Uint16Array`, and `Float32Array`.

- **Data Structures:**
    - **`Set`:** A collection of unique values.
    - **`Map`:** A collection of key-value pairs with ordered entries.
    - **`WeakSet` and `WeakMap`:** Specialized collections with weak references to prevent memory leaks.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd your-repository
Explore the examples:

Check out the examples/ folder for practical uses of map(), filter(), and reduce().
Review typed-arrays.md for information on typed arrays.
Read data-structures.md for details on Set, Map, WeakSet, and WeakMap.
